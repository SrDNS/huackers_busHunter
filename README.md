# huackers_busHunter
## Initialize();
This repository contains all the source code that was developer during the [Transport CrowdHackathon!](http://crowdhackathon.com/transport/).
We have included both client & server side projects.

###Application_Scope();
Our application provides real time monitoring of public transportation using CrowdSourcing model. The users can be notified (even when at home) when his bus approaches his preffered bus station. Also, while they are on board they can be informed of points of interest in the area nearby. Finally, users speciify their disembark stop in order to get notified when the bus approach this stop. 
Our [presentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J3KMxOnJoZVxSxqZzOv5ejt-A9l5VcDVZefvChsFyOA) is available only in Green right now and our [awesome logo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwduKTQoife_RDlEckkxTmFHRXM ).

###ClientSide();
The client side was developer based on [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/)  and [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) in order to implement a cross-platfrom Application.

###Server_side();
The server side was developed using [PHP CodeIgniter](https://ellislab.com/codeigniter) in order to serve all data with REST-API calls.
Our Database was MySql and our initial data was based on OpenData provided by [geodata.gov.gr](http://geodata.gov.gr/geodata/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=28:2011-09-19-11-17-01&catid=1:2010-06-11-13-02-56&Itemid=15)
